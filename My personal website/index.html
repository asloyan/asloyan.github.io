			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div class="about-container">
				<div class="about-text">
					<p>I'm Aidan, an Economics Masters student at the University of Mannheim in Germany. Originally from Ireland, I completed my Bachelor's degree at University College Dublin. My research interests in economics lie in the areas of public economics, health economics, policy analysis, and applied econometrics. I'm passionate about understanding how economic policies can be used to tackle some of the most pressing social and economic challenges facing society today. In my free time, you'll find me running and playing badminton!</p>
					<p>During my undergraduate studies, I wrote a bachelor's thesis analyzing the impact of free access to healthcare for those aged around 70 in Ireland on their utilization of health care services. In Summer 2021, I worked as an intern at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) where I analysed the dwelling and occupant characteristics associated with solid fuel heating, and its health links amongst over-50s in Ireland. More recently, I worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Mannheim Businesss School, Chair of Financial Institutions and Financial Markets.</p>

    			<h3><em>The dwelling and occupant characteristics associated with solid fuel heating, and its health links amongst over-50s in Ireland - ongoing research with Bertrand Ma√Ætre. </em></h3>
    			<p>This paper analyses the relationship between solid fuel heating and respiratory and circulatory disease in Ireland's population aged 50+. Using data from the Irish Household Budget Survey and The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), the study investigated the dwelling and occupant characteristics associated with solid fuel heating and its potential health effects. The results suggest that open fire use is linked with higher rates of respiratory and circulatory disease, but controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and smoking behavior weakens this association.</p>
    			<h3><em>The Effect of Medical Card Access on the Health Care Utilisation of Elderly People in Ireland - my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z5hwvGmMyI0JgGCf59v6ydghT1t3Mhhb/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">bachelor's thesis</a>. </em></h3> </em></h3>
    			<p>This thesis examined the impact of free access to healthcare for over 65s in Ireland on their utilization of health care services. The study utilized data from TILDA and employed interval regression models, probit and logit models, and fuzzy regression discontinuity to examine the relationship between entitlements and the utilization of GP and hospital services for Ireland's population aged 50+. The research findings provide insights into the effect of medical card access on the health care utilization of elderly people in Ireland.</p>
