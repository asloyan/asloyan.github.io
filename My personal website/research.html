		<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>My main research interests are in public economics, health economics, policy analysis, and applied econometrics. </p>
			<p>During my undergraduate studies, I wrote a bachelor's thesis analyzing the impact of free access to healthcare for over 65s in Ireland on their utilization of health care services. In Summer 2021, I worked as an intern at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) where I analysed the dwelling and occupant characteristics associated with solid fuel heating, and its health links amongst over-50s in Ireland. </p>
			<h3><em>The dwelling and occupant characteristics associated with solid fuel heating, and its health links amongst over-50s in Ireland - working paper with Bertrand Ma√Ætre. </em></h3>
			<p>This paper analyzed the relationship between solid fuel heating and respiratory and circulatory disease in Ireland's population aged 50+. Using data from the Irish Household Budget Survey and The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, the study investigated the dwelling and occupant characteristics associated with solid fuel heating and its potential health effects. The results suggest that open fire use is linked with higher rates of respiratory and circulatory disease, but controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and smoking behavior weakens this association.</p>
			<h3><em>The Effect of Medical Card Access on the Health Care Utilisation of Elderly People in Ireland - my bachelor's thesis. </em></h3>
			<p>This thesis examined the impact of free access to healthcare for over 65s in Ireland on their utilization of health care services. The study utilized data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) and employed interval regression models, probit and logit models, and fuzzy regression discontinuity to examine the relationship between entitlements and the utilization of GP and hospital services for Ireland's population aged 50+. The research findings provide insights into the effect of medical card access on the health care utilization of elderly people in Ireland.</p>
